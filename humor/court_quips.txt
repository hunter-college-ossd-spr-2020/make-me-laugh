These are statements made in court that are all actually recorded.
Mary Louise Gilman, the venerable editor of the National Shorthand Reporter 
has collected many of the more hilarious courtroom bloopers in two books - 
Humor in the Court (1977) and More Humor in the Court, published a few months 
ago. From Mrs. Gilman's two volumes, here are some of my favorite transquips,
